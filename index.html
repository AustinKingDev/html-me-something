               This page will guide you through the steps necessary to start producing music through a DAW.
               DAW stands for "digital audio workstation".
               A DAW is used to edit, record, and produce audio files that can then be played back or used in a musical composition.

            The first step to using a DAW is to actually select a DAW to use.
            The most common DAWs are ableton live and fl studio.
            For this guide we will be using ableton live which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/">here.</a>

            <p class="center">
         After you have ableton installed you will need a VST Plugin to use as your virtual instrument.<br>
         VST stands for "Virtual Studio Technology".<br>
         A VST Plug in is used to simulate synthesizers and effects of traditional instruments in a DAW.<br>
         For this guide we will be using the popular VST Plugin Serum which can be downloaded <a href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum">here.</a>

           Now that we have our DAW and VST plug in, we only have one more step before we can start creating music.
           <br>
           We need to accumulate a library of sounds to fill the empty space in our music.<br>(you do not need many to create your first song.)<br><br>
           For this guide our sounds will be accumulated through the subscription based app Splice, which can be downloaded <a href=https://splice.com>here.</a><br>
            Splice allows you to listen to a sound before you spend online currency that is given to you at the start of each month.<br>
            (It is recommended you include at least one of each of the following sounds.<br>Drums(kick drum, snare drum, clap, hi hat, cymbal).<br> FX (white noise, sweep down, sweep up, any miscellaneous effects).
