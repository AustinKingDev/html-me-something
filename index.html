            This page will guide you through the steps necessary to start producing music through a DAW.
            DAW stands for "digital audio workstation".
            A DAW is used to edit, record, and produce audio files that can then be played back or used in a musical composition.

            The first step to using a DAW is to actually select a DAW to use.
            The most common DAWs are ableton live and fl studio.
            For this guide we will be using ableton live which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/">here.</a>

         After you have ableton installed you will need a VST Plugin to use as your virtual instrument.
         VST stands for "Virtual Studio Technology".
         A VST Plug in is used to simulate synthesizers and effects of traditional instruments in a DAW.
         For this guide we will be using the popular VST Plugin Serum which can be downloaded <a href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum">here.</a>

           Now that we have our DAW and VST plug in, we only have one more step before we can start creating music. 
           We need to accumulate a library of sounds to fill the empty space in our music.(you do not need many to create your first song.)
           For this guide our sounds will be accumulated through the subscription based app Splice, which can be downloaded <a href=https://splice.com>here.</a>
            Splice allows you to listen to a sound before you spend online currency that is given to you at the start of each month.
            (It is recommended you include at least one of each of the following sounds.Drums(kick drum, snare drum, clap, hi hat, cymbal). FX (white noise, sweep down, sweep up, any miscellaneous effects).
